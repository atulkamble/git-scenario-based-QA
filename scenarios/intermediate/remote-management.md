# Remote Repository Management Scenarios

## Scenario 1: Working with Multiple Remotes

### Question
You're contributing to an open-source project. You've forked the original repository and need to keep your fork in sync while working on features.

### Setup
```bash
# Fork the original repository on GitHub first
# Then clone your fork
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/project-name.git
cd project-name

# Add original repository as upstream
git remote add upstream https://github.com/original-owner/project-name.git

# Verify remotes
git remote -v
```

### Step-by-Step Workflow

1. **Sync with upstream**
```bash
# Fetch latest changes from upstream
git fetch upstream

# Switch to main branch
git checkout main

# Merge upstream changes
git merge upstream/main

# Push updates to your fork
git push origin main
```

2. **Create feature branch**
```bash
# Create feature branch from updated main
git checkout -b feature/new-contribution

# Make your changes
echo "New feature implementation" > new-feature.js
git add new-feature.js
git commit -m "feat: implement new feature for open source project"

# Push feature branch to your fork
git push origin feature/new-contribution
```

3. **Create Pull Request workflow**
```bash
# Before creating PR, sync with upstream again
git fetch upstream
git checkout main
git merge upstream/main
git push origin main

# Rebase feature branch on latest main
git checkout feature/new-contribution
git rebase main

# Force push rebased feature (use with caution)
git push --force-with-lease origin feature/new-contribution
```

---

## Scenario 2: Handling Force Push Conflicts

### Question
A team member force-pushed to a shared branch, and your local branch is now out of sync. How do you safely recover?

### Problem Simulation
```bash
# Setup initial state
git checkout -b shared-feature
echo "Team member work" > shared-file.txt
git add shared-file.txt
git commit -m "Team member's commit"

# Simulate your local work
echo "Your additional work" >> shared-file.txt
git add shared-file.txt
git commit -m "Your commit on shared branch"

# Simulate force push from remote (done by team member)
# This would normally come from git push, but we'll simulate the conflict
```

### Recovery Steps

1. **Backup your work**
```bash
# Create backup branch
git branch backup-my-work

# Check what commits you have that remote doesn't
git log origin/shared-feature..HEAD --oneline
```

2. **Reset to remote state**
```bash
# Fetch latest remote state
git fetch origin

# Hard reset to remote state (loses local commits)
git reset --hard origin/shared-feature
```

3. **Reapply your changes**
```bash
# Cherry-pick your commits from backup
git cherry-pick backup-my-work

# Or merge your backup branch
git merge backup-my-work

# Resolve any conflicts that arise
```

4. **Alternative: Rebase approach**
```bash
# Instead of reset, rebase your work
git fetch origin
git rebase origin/shared-feature
```

## Scenario 3: Managing Release Branches

### Question
Your team uses a release branching strategy. You need to prepare a release, apply hotfixes, and manage version tags.

### Release Preparation

1. **Create release branch**
```bash
# Create release branch from develop
git checkout develop
git pull origin develop
git checkout -b release/v1.2.0

# Update version files
echo "1.2.0" > VERSION
git add VERSION
git commit -m "chore: bump version to 1.2.0"

# Push release branch
git push origin release/v1.2.0
```

2. **Bug fixes during release**
```bash
# Fix bugs found during testing
echo "Bug fix for release" > bugfix.txt
git add bugfix.txt
git commit -m "fix: resolve critical bug in release"

# Continue with more fixes as needed
```

3. **Finalize release**
```bash
# Merge to main
git checkout main
git merge --no-ff release/v1.2.0
git tag -a v1.2.0 -m "Release version 1.2.0"
git push origin main
git push origin v1.2.0

# Merge back to develop
git checkout develop
git merge --no-ff release/v1.2.0
git push origin develop

# Delete release branch
git branch -d release/v1.2.0
git push origin --delete release/v1.2.0
```

### Hotfix Management

1. **Create hotfix branch**
```bash
# Hotfix from main/production
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git checkout -b hotfix/v1.2.1

# Apply critical fix
echo "Critical security fix" > security-patch.txt
git add security-patch.txt
git commit -m "fix: apply critical security patch"

# Update version
echo "1.2.1" > VERSION
git add VERSION
git commit -m "chore: bump version to 1.2.1"
```

2. **Deploy hotfix**
```bash
# Merge to main
git checkout main
git merge --no-ff hotfix/v1.2.1
git tag -a v1.2.1 -m "Hotfix version 1.2.1"
git push origin main
git push origin v1.2.1

# Merge to develop
git checkout develop
git merge --no-ff hotfix/v1.2.1
git push origin develop

# Clean up
git branch -d hotfix/v1.2.1
git push origin --delete hotfix/v1.2.1
```

## Scenario 4: Large File Management

### Question
Your repository has accumulated large files over time, affecting clone and fetch performance. Implement a strategy to manage this.

### Identify Large Files

1. **Analyze repository size**
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# large-files-analyzer.sh

echo "=== Repository Size Analysis ==="
echo "Total size:"
du -sh .git

echo -e "\n=== Largest files in history ==="
git rev-list --objects --all \
| git cat-file --batch-check='%(objecttype) %(objectname) %(objectsize) %(rest)' \
| sed -n 's/^blob //p' \
| sort --numeric-sort --key=2 \
| tail -10 \
| while read objectname size rest; do
    echo "$(numfmt --to=iec-i --suffix=B $size) $rest"
done

echo -e "\n=== File type sizes ==="
git ls-tree -r --name-only HEAD \
| sed 's/.*\.//' \
| sort \
| uniq -c \
| sort -rn \
| head -10
```

2. **Remove large files from history**
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# remove-large-files.sh

# Remove specific large files from entire history
git filter-branch --force --index-filter \
    'git rm --cached --ignore-unmatch *.zip *.tar.gz *.mp4' \
    --prune-empty --tag-name-filter cat -- --all

# Clean up
rm -rf .git/refs/original/
git reflog expire --expire=now --all
git gc --prune=now --aggressive
```

3. **Implement Git LFS**
```bash
# Install and initialize Git LFS
git lfs install

# Track large file types
git lfs track "*.zip"
git lfs track "*.tar.gz"
git lfs track "*.mp4"
git lfs track "*.psd"
git lfs track "*.mov"

# Add .gitattributes
git add .gitattributes
git commit -m "Configure Git LFS for large files"

# Migrate existing files to LFS
git lfs migrate import --include="*.zip,*.tar.gz,*.mp4,*.psd,*.mov" --everything
```

## Scenario 5: Team Workflow Automation

### Question
Automate common Git workflows for your team, including branch naming conventions, commit message validation, and deployment triggers.

### Branch Naming Convention Script

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# validate-branch-name.sh

current_branch=$(git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD)

# Define valid patterns
valid_patterns=(
    "^feature/[a-z0-9-]+$"
    "^bugfix/[a-z0-9-]+$"
    "^hotfix/[a-z0-9-]+$"
    "^release/v[0-9]+\.[0-9]+\.[0-9]+$"
    "^main$"
    "^develop$"
)

# Check if branch name matches any valid pattern
valid=false
for pattern in "${valid_patterns[@]}"; do
    if [[ $current_branch =~ $pattern ]]; then
        valid=true
        break
    fi
done

if [ "$valid" = false ]; then
    echo "‚ùå Invalid branch name: $current_branch"
    echo "Valid patterns:"
    echo "  feature/feature-name"
    echo "  bugfix/bug-description"
    echo "  hotfix/hotfix-description"
    echo "  release/v1.0.0"
    exit 1
fi

echo "‚úÖ Branch name is valid: $current_branch"
```

### Automated Deployment Script

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# deploy-on-tag.sh

# This script runs in CI/CD when a new tag is created

TAG_NAME=$1

if [[ -z "$TAG_NAME" ]]; then
    echo "No tag provided"
    exit 1
fi

# Validate tag format (v1.2.3)
if [[ ! $TAG_NAME =~ ^v[0-9]+\.[0-9]+\.[0-9]+$ ]]; then
    echo "Invalid tag format: $TAG_NAME"
    exit 1
fi

echo "üöÄ Deploying version $TAG_NAME"

# Extract version number
VERSION=${TAG_NAME#v}

# Build application
echo "üì¶ Building application..."
npm install
npm run build

# Run tests
echo "üß™ Running tests..."
npm test

# Deploy to staging first
echo "üéØ Deploying to staging..."
./deploy-staging.sh $VERSION

# Run integration tests
echo "üîç Running integration tests..."
npm run test:integration

# Deploy to production
echo "üåü Deploying to production..."
./deploy-production.sh $VERSION

echo "‚úÖ Deployment complete for version $TAG_NAME"
```

### Team Workflow Helper Script

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# team-workflow.sh

ACTION=$1
FEATURE_NAME=$2

case $ACTION in
    "start-feature")
        if [ -z "$FEATURE_NAME" ]; then
            echo "Usage: $0 start-feature feature-name"
            exit 1
        fi
        
        echo "üöÄ Starting new feature: $FEATURE_NAME"
        git checkout develop
        git pull origin develop
        git checkout -b "feature/$FEATURE_NAME"
        echo "‚úÖ Feature branch created: feature/$FEATURE_NAME"
        ;;
        
    "finish-feature")
        current_branch=$(git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD)
        
        if [[ ! $current_branch =~ ^feature/ ]]; then
            echo "‚ùå Not on a feature branch"
            exit 1
        fi
        
        echo "üèÅ Finishing feature: $current_branch"
        
        # Push feature branch
        git push origin "$current_branch"
        
        # Create PR (GitHub CLI example)
        if command -v gh &> /dev/null; then
            gh pr create --title "Feature: ${current_branch#feature/}" --body "Auto-generated PR for $current_branch"
        else
            echo "üìù Create PR manually for branch: $current_branch"
        fi
        ;;
        
    "hotfix")
        if [ -z "$FEATURE_NAME" ]; then
            echo "Usage: $0 hotfix hotfix-description"
            exit 1
        fi
        
        echo "üö® Creating hotfix: $FEATURE_NAME"
        git checkout main
        git pull origin main
        git checkout -b "hotfix/$FEATURE_NAME"
        echo "‚úÖ Hotfix branch created: hotfix/$FEATURE_NAME"
        ;;
        
    "sync")
        echo "üîÑ Syncing with remote repositories..."
        git fetch --all --prune
        
        current_branch=$(git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD)
        
        if [ "$current_branch" = "main" ] || [ "$current_branch" = "develop" ]; then
            git pull origin "$current_branch"
        fi
        
        echo "‚úÖ Sync complete"
        ;;
        
    *)
        echo "Usage: $0 {start-feature|finish-feature|hotfix|sync} [feature-name]"
        exit 1
        ;;
esac
```

1. Fork a repository on GitHub
2. Clone your fork locally
3. Add the original repository as upstream
4. Create a feature branch
5. Make changes and create a PR
6. Sync your fork with upstream updates

### Exercise 2: Release Management
1. Create a develop branch
2. Create multiple feature branches
3. Merge features into develop
4. Create a release branch
5. Apply bug fixes to the release
6. Merge to main and tag the release

2. Create conflicting changes in different remotes
3. Practice resolving conflicts during sync operations
4. Learn to use `git fetch` and manual merging vs `git pull`

### Quick Commands Reference for Remote Operations
```bash
# Multiple remotes
git remote add upstream <url>        # Add upstream remote
git fetch --all                      # Fetch from all remotes
git push origin feature-branch       # Push to specific remote
git pull upstream main               # Pull from specific remote

# Force push safely
git push --force-with-lease          # Safer than --force
git push -u origin branch-name       # Set upstream tracking

# Branch management
git branch -vv                       # Show tracking branches
git branch --set-upstream-to=origin/main  # Set tracking branch
git push origin --delete branch-name # Delete remote branch

# Tag management
git push origin --tags               # Push all tags
git push origin tag-name             # Push specific tag
git fetch --tags                     # Fetch all tags
```
